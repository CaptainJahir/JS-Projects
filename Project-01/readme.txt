To-Do List Website => 

This repository contains a To-Do List web application that I have developed. The application allows users to add, delete, and track tasks, and uses localStorage to save the data on the client's browser, so tasks persist 
across sessions.

Features
Add new tasks: Users can input tasks through an input field and add them to the list.
Remove tasks: Completed tasks can be removed from the list.
Persistent Data: All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain saved even if the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.



Technologies Used => 

HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for functionality
localStorage to save data in the client's browser.


Updates Ineed ToDo => 

1) Mark tasks as completed: Marking a task as completed by clicking on done button. => i have Tried to Achive this but i can't because this is my first js project i don't know much about JS. I'm Still Praticing so I will
